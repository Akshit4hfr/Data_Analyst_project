# Data_Analyst_project

👋 Introduction

This project showcases my ability to perform end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL on a real-world dataset of global tech layoffs. The goal was to move beyond raw tables and transform data into meaningful business insights by identifying trends over time, ranking top-impact companies, and analyzing layoffs across industries, locations, and funding stages.

Through this analysis, I demonstrate strong command of:

Writing complex SQL queries

Using CTEs and window functions for advanced analytics

Performing time-series trend analysis

Aggregating large datasets to answer strategic questions

Translating raw data into structured insights that support decision-making

This repository is designed to reflect the type of analytical thinking required in a Data Analyst role—from initial exploration to trend discovery and performance comparison across years.

Recruiters reviewing this project will find clear, well-documented SQL scripts, logical analytical progression, and business-focused questions that mirror real-world workforce analytics scenarios.
